# Project Report on Fuel Consumption Analysis (2000-2022)

## Introduction
The dataset covers vehicle fuel consumption records between 2000 and 2022. It includes information on vehicle types, engine sizes, fuel types, fuel consumption metrics, and CO2 emissions. The goal is to analyze fuel consumption patterns, CO2 emissions, and key insights from the dataset using a Power BI dashboard.

## Dataset Overview
- **Size**: 22,556 rows and 13 columns.
- **Time Period**: 2000-2022.
- **Fields**:
  - **YEAR**: Year of vehicle registration.
  - **MAKE**: Vehicle manufacturer.
  - **MODEL**: Vehicle model.
  - **VEHICLE CLASS**: Vehicle category (e.g., Compact, Mid-size).
  - **ENGINE SIZE**: Engine size in liters.
  - **CYLINDERS**: Number of engine cylinders.
  - **TRANSMISSION**: Transmission type (Manual/Automatic).
  - **FUEL**: Type of fuel (Regular, Premium gasoline).
  - **FUEL CONSUMPTION (L/100 km)**: City fuel consumption (L/100 km).
  - **HWY (L/100 km)**: Highway fuel consumption (L/100 km).
  - **COMB (L/100 km)**: Combined fuel consumption (L/100 km).
  - **EFFICIENCY (mpg)**: Combined fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.
  - **EMISSIONS**: CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer.

## Analysis Goals
The Power BI dashboard will provide insights into the following areas:
1. **Highest Fuel Consumption Year**:
   - Identify the year with the highest overall fuel consumption.
2. **Highest Emission Year**:
   - Determine which year had the highest total CO2 emissions from vehicles.
3. **Emissions by Manufacturer**:
   - Analyze CO2 emissions produced by each vehicle manufacturer.
4. **Overall Fuel Consumed**:
   - Calculate the total amount of fuel consumed across all years and visualize it.
5. **CO2 Emissions by Fuel Type**:
   - Compare CO2 emissions based on fuel type (e.g., Regular gasoline vs. Premium gasoline).
6. **Fuel Consumption vs. Highway Fuel Consumption**:
   - Analyze the relationship between city fuel consumption and highway fuel consumption.
7. **Year-wise Slicer**:
   - Implement a slicer for selecting specific years to filter the data and examine trends over time.
8. **Fuel-wise Slicer**:
   - Select specific fuel types to filter overall emissions and fuel consumption.

## Conclusion
- The dashboard will enable users to quickly identify key trends in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- It will offer manufacturers and environmental analysts insights into fuel efficiency and the environmental impact of vehicles over time.

## Key Insights Expected
- A clear identification of the highest fuel-consuming and emission-generating years.
- Detailed emissions data segmented by manufacturer.
- Year-over-year fuel consumption and emission trends.
